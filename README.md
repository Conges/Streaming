# Streaming
This module is responsible for streaming data between hosts in order to validate our concept of congestion control by using [SR] protocol, [SDN] architecture, and [TCP] congestion state monitoring. We need to simulate data centers traffic between its nodes, therefore we are developing a [FTP] application which is responsible for sending data in the form of files.
